Spark Funds Investment Analysis

Project Overview
Spark Funds, an asset management company, is looking to make strategic investments in companies across various sectors. The goal of this project is to analyze global investment trends to help the company identify the best sectors, countries, and investment types for potential investments.

Spark Funds has two investment constraints:

1. The investment amount per round should be between 5 to 15 million USD.
2. Investments should be made in English-speaking countries, where English is one of the official languages.

Business Objective:
The key business objective is to identify:

1. The most suitable investment type.
2. The best-performing countries for investment.
3. The most attractive sectors for investment.

Data Sources:
The dataset used for this analysis comes from real investment data from Crunchbase. The project utilizes three primary data files:

1. Companies: Data on companies receiving investments.
2. Rounds2: Information on various investment rounds.
3. Mapping: File used to map sub-sectors to the main sectors.

Approach:
This project involves three key areas of analysis:

1. Investment Type Analysis: Compared various investment types such as venture, seed, angel, and private equity to determine the best-suited type for Spark Fundsâ€™ strategy.
2. Country Analysis: Identified the top countries where the most investments have been made and focus on English-speaking nations.
3. Sector Analysis: Analyzed the distribution of investments across the main sectors to identify the most lucrative areas.

Technical Implementation:
The analysis has been conducted in Python, and all the code for the project has been written in a Jupyter notebook. This includes:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to draw insights from the dataset.
3. Analysis of investment types, countries, and sectors.
4. Visualizations to support the analysis.

Conclusion:
This project provides actionable insights to help Spark Funds make informed investment decisions based on global trends. By focusing on the right countries, sectors, and investment types, Spark Funds can align its strategy with the prevailing trends in the investment landscape.
